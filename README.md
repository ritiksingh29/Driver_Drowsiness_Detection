# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection

This repository encompasses the source code for a driver drowsiness detection project, which is designed to employ computer vision methodologies and deep learning techniques for real-time detection of driver fatigue. The implementation utilizes OpenCV for the detection of facial features, such as eyes, and leverages Keras to construct and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of drowsiness.

The provided code not only establishes the model's architecture but also loads pre-trained model weights, enabling real-time detection of drowsiness by making predictions about the state of the driver's eyes.

We welcome you to explore and utilize this repository as a foundational resource for initiating your own driver drowsiness detection project.
